                        I recieved a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I

                        "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition sna have heard some 
                        people who had an amazing experience here. I singed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I 
                        enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most qrueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                        the course, I've succesfuly switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

                    "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help 
                    me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of their who can only say wonderful things
                    about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disapoint. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. 
                    It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during 
                    interviews as an example of my davalopment experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack development after 
                    receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend."
