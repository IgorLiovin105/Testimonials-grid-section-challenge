                        I recieved a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I 
                        got every penny's worth.

                        people who had an amazing experience here. I singed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I 
                        enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most qrueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                        the course, I've succesfuly switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."
